# Known issues to be resolved

## factory.py
1. PET: Units are hard-coded as BQML
1. PET: CountSource is hardcoded as EMISSION
1. PET: Determine CollimatorType from Inveon header
1. PET: DecayCorrection, need to distinguish between START and ADMIN
1. PET: CorrectedImage, need to review
1. PET: PatientGantryRelationship is hard coded
1. PET: ImageType is hard coded in create_pet_image_module
1. PET: RescaleIntercept and RescaleSlope are hard coded in create_pet_image_module
1. PET: ImageType is hard coded in create_enhanced_pet_image_module
1. PET: AcquisitionDuration is hard coded in create_enhanced_pet_image_module
1. PET: Other hard coded values in create_enhanced_pet_image_module
1. CT: create_enhanced_ct_image_module is not complete
1. create_patient_module uses "" for patient_name, patient_id, patient_dob, patient_sex
1. create_image_pixel_module makes many assumptions about pixel configuration
1. create_image_pixel_module assumes input data are 2-byte integers, ignores floats

## dicom.py
1. fill_pixel_measures_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_frame_content_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_unassigned_per_frame_converted_attributes_sequence hars hard coded values
1. fill_pixel_measures_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_frame_content_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_unassigned_per_frame_converted_attributes_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_ct_image_frame_type_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_pet_frame_type_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_plane_orientation_sequence has hard coded values
1. fill_plane_position_sequence has hard coded values and has a weird way of creating an empty Dataset
1. MultiframeDimensionModule constructor has hard coded values
1. Change all consructors that compute ImageType to take a single string. Let the factory figure this out.
1. EnhancedCTImageModule constructor needs work



## General
1. Need a review of String / Integer variables. We are inconsistent in usage
1. Need a way to add subject information (Name, ID, DOB, Sex) from the command line
1. Bonus points for handling multi-subject data per the DICOM Standard
