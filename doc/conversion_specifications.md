# Specifications for Inveon to DICOM Conversion

## Items Not Addressed.
1. Siemens documentation indicates they produce NM images, but we do not know how to identify/distinguish NM from PET data.

1. CT: Will not support Multi-Energy CT.

1. PET: Will not support gated studies.

1. PET and CT: Will not syncrhonize the x,y,z positions and use a common Frame of Reference between the series.

1. Hotel images: This software has no explicit support for multi-animal DICOM files.

## Open Issues (Priority Order)
### Larger Issues

1. PET: Need to translate float pixel values to 16 bit integers for DICOM.
   - Method is under review by Richard Laforest

1. CT, PET: Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) is defined as: *The direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. *. This should be mapped from subject_orientation. I do not know the mapping.

1. CT, PET: Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) contains the X,Y,Z position of a plane. With help from Richard Laforest, we empirically derived the equations for these three values. This is described below. This could use review, especially in the context of different orientations of the mouse subjects. We especially need to review why we had to reverse the sign on the x and y position calculations.

1. PET: Inveon header has values for isotope and injected_compound. We are using isotope to create a coded entry in the Radionuclide Code Sequence. How should we use injected_compound?

1. CT: Do we want to add the Siemens private data for CT? It is described in their Conformance Statement.

1. CT: Do we want to add the Siemens private data for PET? It is described in their Conformance Statement.

### Smaller Issues
1. PET: Decay Correction (0054,1102) can take on the values NONE, START, ADMIN. What is in the Inveon header that map to the correct values?

1. PET: Is decay_correction the right value to use for DICOM Decay Factor (0054,1321)?

1. PET: The mapping table from isotope to the code value in Radionuclide Code Sequence needs to be completed. This one mapping exists:
   - F-18 --> (C-111A1, SNM3, ^18^Fluorine)
   - See [CID 4020 PET Radionuclide](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part16.html#sect_CID_4020) for the list of coded values. We do not know the values that can be entered in the scanner for isotope.

1. CT, PET: Some code exists for Enhanced CT and Enhanced PET. That should be removed, and we should focus on traditional CT and PET images.

1. PET Review the computed value for Image Index (0054,1330)

1. CT, PET: Review how the values for Image Type (0008,0008) are determined.

1. CT, PET: Current software accepts Patient/Subject Name, ID, DOB, Sex from command line. These values are available in the header, but is there a standard format so we can populate the DICOM header properly
   - subject_date_of_birth
   - subject_sex
   - subject_identifier
   - subject_genus
   - subject_phenotype

1. CT, PET: Patient Study Module. Nothing is included today.
  - What is the format of subject_age so we can place this in the DICOM metadata?
  - Do we want to map subject_length into the DICOM metadata (Patient's Size 0010,1020)
  - Do we want to map subject_weight into the DICOM metadata (Patient's Weight 0010,1030)



## Common to All Modalities
The modules below are common to CT and PET and are listed separately to avoid duplication.

### Patient
| Attribute Name        | Tag         | Conversion         |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Patient's Name        | (0010,0010) | From command line  |
| Patient ID            | (0010,0020) | From command line  |
| Patient's Birth Date  | (0010,0030) | From command line  |
| Patient's Sex         | (0010,0040) | From command line  |

Notes:
1. We are not supporting multi-animal DICOM files (hotel sessions)
2. We chose to accept the four demographic fields from the command line. We could grab one or more values from the Inveon header and maintain command line overrides.
3. These fields are listed in the sample Inveon header files we have. We do not know if any format conversions are necessary.
   - subject_date_of_birth
   - subject_sex
   - subject_identifier
   - subject_genus

TODO:
1. Review what demographic fields could be pulled from the Inveon header
2. As part of the review, determine if any format conversions are needed to satisfy the DICOM Standard.

####  Calculating X, Y, Z positions of the image plane
   - Variables below
      - $var refers to a local variable
      - {variable} refer to named variables of the same name in the Inveon header file. We take one liberty (next item)
   - The value image_ref_shift is defined as "Image reference shift (X, Y, Z), in mm, applied to data set (float float float)". In the notation below, we will use image_ref_shift(x) to indicate the shift in the x position with similar notation for y and z.
   - All calculations are in mm
   - These are the names of the variables we use from the Inveon header
      - image_ref_shift
      - pixel_size_x, pixel_size_y, pixel_size_z
      - x_dimension, y_dimension, z_dimension
   - See note after the equations about open issues

    $x_delta = {image_shift_ref(x)}
    $y_delta = {image_shift_ref(y)}
    $y_delta = {image_shift_ref(y)}
    
    $x_position =    (({x_dimension}/2-1) / 2 * {pixel_size_x}) - x_delta
    $y_position =  -((({y_dimension}/2-1) / 2 * {pixel_size_y}) - y_delta)

    $index: Ranges from 0 to number of slices - 1
    $z_position = (($index + .5 - z_dimension/2) * pixel_size_z) + z_delta

Notes on x, y, z positions
1. Equations for determining x, y, z positions were developed empirically and then compared to output produced by the Inveon workstation.
2. Equations do not take into consider any orientation information (HFS, FFS, etc.) that is found in the header information.
3. We especially need to review why we had to reverse the sign on the x and y position calculations.

Notes:
1. All pixels converted to 16 bit integers if not already in that format. For example, floating point values are converted.
2. Pixel Representation is 2's complement
3. See calculations below

#### Image Pixel Calculations
The header variable data_type defines the format of the pixel data in the .img file. The software derives the pixel data as follows:

    switch data_type:
      case 2:     // 2-byte integer - Intel style
        read/return 2 byte integers as they exist in the file

      case 4:    // 4-byte float - Intel style
        convert float to integer; see below

      all others: (0, 1 3, 5, 6 7)
        raise exception

This describes the conversion of floating point data to 2-byte integers. We assume that we only get 4-byte float inputs for PET data. That assumption needs to be reviews.

Variables below
   - $var refers to a local variable
   - {variable} refer to named variables of the same name in the Inveon header file.
   - These are the names of the variables we use from the Inveon header
      - x_dimension, y_dimension
      - scale_factor
      - calibraton_factor
      - isotope_branching_fraction
      - maximum (conditioned on the time frame you are in)

    $max_scaled = {maximum} * {calibration_factor} * {scale_factor} / {isotope_branching_fraction} * 37
    $pixel_scale = {calibration_factor} * {scale_factor} / {isotope_branching_fraction} * 37 * (32767 / {max_scaled})
    $float_pixels = array of floating point pixel values

    for $i = 0 to float_pixels.lengh - 1:
      $int_pixel[$i] = $float_pixel[$i] * $pixel_scale
    done
    return $int_pixel (array of integer pixels)
